# Bulldozer Sale Prices Prediction

This project is my attempt at the Kaggle's Blue Book for Bulldozers competition. The goal is to predict auction sale prices of bulldozers given sales records with information about the bulldozers.

The model that performed the best in this dataset was the Random Forest model and it got a root mean squared log error score of 0.2438 in the validation set. Unfortunately, this competition has already finished a few years ago and it isn't possible to submit a solution to Kaggle anymore.
